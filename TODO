* Improvements

- Remove the ex1.output ex1.i18n-extractor duplication. (or move to tmp dir): Move to test/tmp a-la the way workflow is working.
- Add {} to disallowed characters
- Add yaml fixtures and compare those
- Refactor tests: split out what is integration vs unit, too much coupling.
- Prompter.new should just be a singleton.
- rm hax_shit, move to setup/teardown, shutdown/startup
- make directories now that are more abstractions? finder/ -> finder,exceptionfinder,etc...replacer/ -> parser too, & stuffz?
- rm the :overwrite, :dump stuff to UserAction?

* Issues

- CLI options: Extractor.new accepts options. pass through workflow. First up: yaml_file (issue#5)
- add a ~/.i18n-extractor file/dir/config file etc. to keep preferences of interactive mode or not?

 * Ideas

- handled email suffixes (foo.en.html.haml etc)
- add herbgobbler (ERB) and this to another more generalized repo for translating templates?
